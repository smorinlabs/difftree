## [0.x.y] - YYYY-MM-DD (Unreleased)

### Added

- Added comprehensive sorting options for both classic and interactive modes:
  - `--sort <TYPE>`: Sort by name (default), size, modified time, or extension
  - `--dirs-first`: Sort directories before files
  - `--case-sensitive`: Use case-sensitive sorting with specific order (numbers → uppercase → lowercase)
  - `--natural-sort`: Version-aware sorting (file1 < file2 < file10)
  - `--reverse`: Reverse any sort order
  - `--dotfiles-first`: Priority ordering (dotfolders → folders → dotfiles → files)

- Added comprehensive examples directory (`examples/sample-directory/`) with various file types, nested structures, and test scenarios for validating lstr functionality including icons, gitignore behavior, and tree display.

- Added interactive search functionality in TUI mode:
  - Press `/` to enter search mode with real-time filename filtering
  - Case-insensitive substring matching filters files as you type
  - Press `Esc` to exit search and restore full file list
  - Status line shows current search query and match count
  - Preserves tree structure and selection state during filtering ([Closes #30](https://github.com/bgreenwell/lstr/issues/30))

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Fixed fundamental tree structure corruption caused by flat sorting destroying parent-child relationships. Implemented tree-aware hierarchical sorting that preserves proper tree traversal order while sorting siblings within their respective parent directories. This resolves multiple cascading issues:
  - Fixed tree display connector issue where all entries showed `└──` instead of proper mixed `├──` and `└──` connectors ([Closes #36](https://github.com/bgreenwell/lstr/issues/36))
  - Fixed incorrect file nesting where children appeared under wrong parents or in jumbled order
  - Fixed duplicate/phantom entries in interactive TUI mode caused by corrupted tree structure
  - Fixed missing entries when tree structure calculations failed
  - Ensured consistent output between classic and TUI modes
  
- Added shared `sort_entries_hierarchically()` function to sort module for tree-aware sorting used by both classic and interactive modes

- Fixed alignment issues with permissions (`-p`) and git status (`-G`) flags where root directory formatting was inconsistent with tree entries. Root directory now properly displays permissions and git status spacing for consistent output alignment. ([Closes #32](https://github.com/bgreenwell/lstr/issues/32))

## [0.2.1] - 2025-06-23

### Removed 

- Removed the `rayon` dependency and parallel tree walking for now (related to [#10](https://github.com/bgreenwell/lstr/issues/20)).

### Added

- Integrated the `lscolors` crate to respect the `LS_COLORS` environment variable, allowing for user-configurable file and directory colors that match their system's theme.

- Added a Nix flake configuration (`flake.nix`) to provide a consistent and reproducible development environment for contributors. ([PR #10](https://github.com/bgreenwell/lstr/pull/10))

### Fixed

- Fixed garbled color output (raw ANSI codes) in the classic view mode on some Windows terminals. The application now explicitly enables virtual terminal processing on startup, ensuring color codes are interpreted correctly.

- In interactive mode, the selection highlight was changed to use reverse video, guaranteeing visibility and contrast regardless of the underlying file color.

- Fixed a double-input bug in interactive mode on Windows that caused erratic navigation. The TUI now correctly filters for key press events. ([Closes #21](https://github.com/bgreenwell/lstr/issues/21))

- Fixed a critical issue where the classic `view` mode could produce scrambled and incorrect directory trees on certain systems, particularly on Windows. The directory walker for this mode was changed to a serial implementation to guarantee a consistent and correct output order in all environments. ([Closes #20](https://github.com/bgreenwell/lstr/issues/20))

- Optimized the release build profile in `Cargo.toml` by enabling LTO, stripping symbols, and setting `panic = "abort"`, significantly reducing the final binary size. ([PR #11](https://github.com/bgreenwell/lstr/pull/11))

- Removed the build-time dependency on `openssl` by disabling default features for the `git2` crate, which simplifies building from source.

- Refactored the project to use the version of `crossterm` re-exported by `ratatui`, preventing potential dependency version conflicts. ([PR #13](https://github.com/bgreenwell/lstr/pull/13))

- Optimized the `git2` dependency by disabling its default features. This removes the build-time requirement for `openssl` and reduces the total number of dependencies. ([PR #5](https://github.com/bgreenwell/lstr/pull/5))

- Fixed broken icons in GIF. ([Closes #4](https://github.com/bgreenwell/lstr/issues/4))

## [0.2.0] - 2025-06-17

### Added

-   **Interactive Mode:** A new `interactive` subcommand that launches a terminal-based UI.
    -   Keyboard-driven navigation (`Up`/`Down`, `j`/`k`).
    -   Directory expansion and collapsing with `Enter`.
    -   Ability to open selected files in the default editor (`$EDITOR`).

-   **Git Integration:** A new `-G, --git-status` flag displays file statuses (`M`, `A`, `?`, etc.) in both classic and interactive modes.

-   **Shell Integration:** In interactive mode, pressing `Ctrl+s` now quits and prints the selected path to `stdout`, allowing `lstr` to be used as a file picker for other shell commands.

-   **Rich Information Display:**
    -   Added `--icons` flag to display file-specific icons (requires a Nerd Font).
    -   Added `-s, --size` flag to display file sizes.
    -   Added `-p, --permissions` flag to display file permissions (Unix-like systems only).

### Fixed

-   Resolved an issue where the `--gitignore` (`-g`) flag would fail to ignore files in certain environments.

-   Fixed a critical bug where the interactive TUI would hang and produce garbled output when piped to another command.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-06-06

### Added

- Initial release of `lstr`.

- Core recursive directory tree walking and printing functionality.

- Colorized output for directories, configurable with the `--color` flag (`always`, `auto`, `never`).

- Control over recursion depth via the `-L` flag.

- Option to display directories only via the `-d` flag.

- Option to show hidden files and directories via the `-a` flag.

- Ability to respect `.gitignore` and other standard ignore files via the `-g` flag.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-06

- Initial release.
